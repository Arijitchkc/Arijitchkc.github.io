#### Others

I also spend considerable time learning useful programming languages, which I think is very important to know. I started learning them since the Covid-19 lockdown(At least I could bring some good things out of it!). I now use a combination of these programming/scripting languages for my daily research purposes. These languages are:-

* Python
* Fortran
* C and C++
* bash 
* GMT
